# Predicting-Patient-Outcomes-using-ASA-Classification
This project leverages machine learning to predict ASA classifications and patient discharge times. By addressing class imbalance and conducting feature engineering, the models improve patient care, surgical decision-making, and resource management, evaluated through key performance metrics.
# Key Features:
ASA Classification Prediction: Implemented classification models to predict ASA classifications, aiding in surgical decision-making and risk assessment.
Data Preprocessing: Conducted comprehensive data analysis and preprocessing of healthcare datasets to ensure data quality and model accuracy.
Handling Class Imbalance: Addressed class imbalance through random oversampling techniques to improve model performance in minority classes.
Outcome Prediction: Evaluated classification models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to predict patient outcomes.
Discharge Time Prediction: Utilized Random Forest Regression and other regression techniques to predict patient discharge times.
Feature Engineering: Conducted feature engineering and selection to enhance prediction accuracy for both outcome and discharge time.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated regression models using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess discharge time predictions.
